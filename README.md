# bash_fun
Just a couple of more or less useful bash functions.

cpwd - copies working directory, also remotely. (-f copy exact path to file, -x copy exact path to remote file)

cprf - copies remote file from clipboard to path or sends file to path in clipboard (-g "grab" file from clipboard to designated path, -f "forwards" designated file to path in clipboard)
